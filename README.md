# 📈 Sales Forecasting with Machine Learning

This project presents a machine learning approach to forecast future sales using historical sales data. Implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook, it features data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and visualization to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Cleaned and preprocessed sales data
- Handled missing values using `SimpleImputer`
- Created machine learning pipeline using `make_pipeline`
- Trained `GradientBoostingRegressor` for accurate forecasting
- Visualized results to interpret the model output

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`
